      <description>Dataset Introduction I have chosen the dataset “HealthInsurance” which looks at the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data from 1996. It has 8,802 rows and 11 columns. The variables which are pretty self explanatory are age, gender, insurance, marriage status, self-employed, family size, region, ethnicity, and education. Two variables which require interpretation are 1) health (self-reported binary status of healthy or not), and 2) limit (is there any limitation on this person).</description>

      <description>Introduction The first dataset that I have chosen to examine for this project is the “pwt_sample” dataset, which has 1,428 observations and 7 variables. The dataset gives macroeconomic data for 21 countries. The variables are country, the country’s ISO code, year, population in millions, human capital index, real GDP at 2011 prices, and a share of labor compensation in GDP. The second dataset that I have chosen to examine is the “ghp100k” dataset, which has 561 observations and 3 variables.</description>
