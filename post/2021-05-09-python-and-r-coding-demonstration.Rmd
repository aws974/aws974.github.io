how are you doing today? i may be an extremely new coder, but i can show you some simple code to demontrate how python and R can work together using reticulate.


first, in R, we will run this code:

```{r}
library(reticulate)
Alexis <- "I love"
```


then, in python, we will run this code: 

```{python}
Salim="food and cooking"
print(r.Alexis, Salim)
```

pretty cool, it took something from R and put it into the python chunk to print out a sentence



the same sentence can be printed in an R chunk like this:

```{r}
cat(c(Alexis, py$Salim))
```


in sum, you can tell that i really care about food and cooking :) i hope this simple demonstration made sense! 

here's a picture of one of my favorite desserts from Japan: kakigori! it's a wonderfully light rendition of shaved ice
