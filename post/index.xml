library(reticulate) Alexis &amp;lt;- &amp;quot;I love&amp;quot; then, in python, we will run this code:
Salim=&amp;quot;food and cooking&amp;quot; print(r.Alexis, Salim) ## I love food and cooking pretty cool, it took something from R and put it into the python chunk to print out a sentence</description>
